Mary had  lil lamb
 Little lamb, lil lamb
 Mary had  lil lamb
 It's fleece wuz white as snow
 Everywhere dat Mary went
 Mary went, Mary went
 Everywhere dat Mary went
 The lamb wuz sure 2 go
 It followed her 2 school wan day
 School wan day, school wan day
 It followed her 2 school wan day
 Which wuz againts teh rules
 It made teh children laff an play
 Laugh an play, laff an play
 It made teh children laff an play
 To c teh lamb at school
 And so teh teacher turnd it out
 Turned it out, turnd it out
 And so teh teacher turnd it out
 But still it lingered near
 Why doez teh lamb luv Mary so?
 Love Mary so, luv Mary so
 Why doez teh lamb luv Mary so?
 The eager children cry
 Why, Mary luvz teh lamb, u know
 The lamb, u know, teh lamb, u know
 Why, Mary luvz teh lamb, u know
 The teacher did reply
 Mary had  lil lamb
 Little lamb, lil lamb
 Mary had  lil lamb
 It's fleece wuz white as snow
 Everywhere dat Mary went
 Mary went, Mary went
 Everywhere dat Mary went
 The lamb wuz sure 2 go
 Mary had  lil lamb
 Little lamb, lil lamb
 Mary had  lil lamb
 It's fleece wuz white as snow
